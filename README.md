# BattleSub
Will eventually become a two player 2D submarine game with some fluid dynamics.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bfeldpw/battlesub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bfeldpw/battlesub)

At the moment, there is just code cleanup. A proper readme will be written soon.
To build and install after cloning run
```bash
cd scripts
./build_dependencies && ./build
```
from BattleSub directory.

If successful, run BattleSub using `./run` or `/<path>/<to>/scripts/run` if in another directory.
